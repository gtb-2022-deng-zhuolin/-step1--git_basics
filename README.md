To be fairly honest, I'm a *warm* person... Maybe this is the reason I don't like the cold atmosphere.

I can speak/read/write:
 - Chinese,
 - English,
 - French
 - ...

Btw the way, I've studied in the mediterranean coast, where we have "Nice" weather, slow life......

⬆️⬆️ This is the most tranquil town I have lived... We can really enjoy the afternoon at the street Café or ski at the Aples...
